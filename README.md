# What Is That Fruit?

## Description üçèüçåüçä

This little personal project was created to put into practice the skills acquired during the Le Wagon Data Science bootcamp. It's a simple web application where you can upload an image, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, trained with Kaggle data, will detect which type of fruit it is. It's a fun way to test your fruit recognition skills!

## Instructions üìù

1. **Installation**: To get started with this project, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **API Configuration**: You'll need to configure the API service. Make sure to replace the API URL in the `.env` file with the URL where you'll be running the API service. You can find the API service for this project [here](https://github.com/nachmz42/what-is-that-fruit-back).

3. **Run the Application**: Once the API is set up, you can run the React application using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your web browser.

4. **Usage**: Upload an image of a fruit, and the CNN model will identify which fruit it is. Have fun guessing the fruits!
